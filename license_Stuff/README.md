# INTRO
Welcome to Spotify Collab, as the welcome page says this is an application for suggesting songs while on a roadtrip or in teh car and you dont want to use the DJ's phone. this is basictally a collabarative playlist that you and your friends make by suggesting and playing songs. look below for usage and other stuff.

# USAGE
This is not the thing your looking for (Nothings been implemented yet, look at me later)

# Future Stuff
looing to add this as a mobile app and or websight hosted not inhouse ar somthing clever like a local multi host for the session. looking to add minimal security and (100% not going to happen) but an actual integration with Spotify.
